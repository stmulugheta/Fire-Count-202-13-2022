The objectives of conducting the appraisal process are not limited to enhancing\n","employee understanding of Mitsui’s management philosophy, or to providing input for setting compensation\n","or assigning new positions, but also include promoting talent development through the appraisal process.\n","Appraisal meetings, such as one-on-one meetings, are held periodically between employees and their\n","managers, and employees receive comprehensive feedback on their performance and specific contributions.\n","These meetings create an effective framework for human resources/personal ability development.\n","\n","The appraisal system for staff hired in Japan consists of two types of appraisal criteria: “Individual\n","\n","74\n","\n","Human Resources Management\n","\n","Competency Appraisal’ and “Contribution Appraisal” For the “Individual Competency Appraisal)’ an appraiser\n","performs a comparative assessment of the competency of an employee in relation to other employees in the\n","same appraisal group; this appraisal is used for and reflected in decisions regarding employee promotion, job\n","assignments, salary, and so on, in accordance with the cumulative points in the employee's individual\n","competency appraisals over the most recent three years. Having cumulative points from appraisals for three\n","years, rather than a single-year appraisal result, avoids a one-time effect and enables appropriate appraisals as\n","to how an employee has been developing during the three-year period, and for considering promotions.\n","\n","For the “Contribution Appraisal;’ setting out appropriate targets is the premise for an appropriate appraisal.\n","\n","As such, employees and their managers must engage in in-depth discussions in order to share a common\n","understanding of the established targets, so that the targets will be challenging and acceptable to both\n","parties. An appraiser assesses the value added to, and the degree of contribution made to the company\n","\n","by an employee, as well as the degree to which the employee has taken on challenges to achieve a target.\n","We also have a mechanism whereby the results of these appraisals are linked to the performance of\n","\n","the company, and reflected in the bonus. In the fiscal year ended March 2019, we revised these appraisal\n","systems. We have incorporated a mechanism to allow both promotion and demotion in order to facilitate\n","the early promotion of employees who produce outstanding results and demonstrate strong capabilities,\n","and to give them roles with greater responsibility, while also carrying out finely-tuned assessments with\n","\n","the aim of fostering a healthy sense of urgency. Furthermore, we have introduced the President's bonus to\n","reward employees who make a noteworthy contribution to or who produce outstanding results toward\n","strengthening Mitsui’s earnings base, or who take on difficult challenges aspiring to new heights.\n","\n","Interactive Communications between Line Managers and Team Staff\n","\n"," \n","\n","One-on-One Program\n","\n","In order to realize more highly motivated workplaces through support for cultivating a strong relationship of\n","trust among employees and for improving their performance, we encourage one-on-one meetings between\n","line managers and their team staff at least once a month. We have launched the One-on-One Program for\n","departmental GMs in the Head Office and offices in Japan to help them with these one-on-one meetings.\n","Through this program, GMs can secure time to regularly communicate with their team staffs, which increases\n","communication time and enhances the quality of communication. As a result, GMs participating in this\n","program gain a deeper understanding of their team staffs. As a measure for supporting staff to grow into\n","strong individuals, about 90% of the departmental GM participants gave positive feedback.\n","\n","Mitsui Management Review (MMR)\n","\n","In the fiscal year ended March 2006, we introduced the Mitsui Management Review (MMR) for line managers\n","responsible for handling global consolidated management in Japan and overseas, as well as at affiliated\n","companies, as an opportunity for them to gain insights by reflecting on their own management and\n","\fSocial\n","\n"," \n","\n","leadership capabilities. Members of the organization working under each manager rate him or her, providing\n","an opportunity for the manager to reflect on his or her own performance based on the results, and to\n","implement management style improvements. In recent years, the MMR is carried out once every two years,\n","and in the fiscal year ended March 2019, the program was held for 1,176 managers. In addition, workplace\n","meetings are held to give direct feedback to members of the organizations about the insights. By sharing the\n","views of both managers and their team staffs, it helps to clarify the challenges they need to tackle in the\n","workplace. As such, the MMR is leading toward the creation of more open and communicative workplaces\n","where discussions contributing to the improvement of management are actively carried out, and the\n","enhancement of bidirectional communication between line managers and team staffs.\n","\n","On the other hand, in the past 15 years since the launch of this program, required conduct, capabilities, and\n","qualifications for managers and leaders have changed. For example, they now need to manage more diverse\n","and competent human resources, and cope with changing work environments. Organizational management\n","capabilities required of line managers are also becoming more and more sophisticated. As such, proper\n","evaluation of leader adequacy and stepped-up efforts to foster talented leaders are becoming important\n","challenges more than ever. In order to be adaptive to various challenges, we are considering revising the MMR.\n","The plan is to include line manager candidates to its participants, and use the results of the new MMR program\n","as a reference when promoting them to line managers. Also, by including line managers and colleagues to\n","those who provide objective perspectives in evaluations, the MMR can have multi-layered, 360° viewpoints,\n","which result in upgrading the evaluation approach to be more transparent, objective, and convincing. Through\n","such operational improvements among others, we will enhance our human resource development.\n","\n","Employee Dormitories\n","\n"," \n","\n","Mitsui has been maintaining employee dormitories for many years. Not just to offer secure, comfortable\n","living environments to young employees, we also hope to achieve various synergies through having\n","employees live together.\n","\n","When dormitory residents learn from their seniors/juniors and colleagues, and compete with each\n","other, autonomous growth is encouraged. We believe that personal networks beyond organizational\n","boundaries built at dormitories and a sense of community, as well as everyday life itself at dormitories, will\n","become invaluable assets for their future, and we encourage new graduates hired by the company, in\n","particular, to make use of our dormitories.\n","\n","At present, almost 360 employees, mostly young employees who have been with Mitsui for up to\n","three years, reside in four dormitories located in the suburbs of Tokyo. Inter-dormitory sports competitions\n","and other events as well as everyday life at each dormitory help to deepen communication among\n","employees along vertical, horizontal, and diagonal axes.\n","\n","Because dormitory residents include regionally hired staff who stay in Japan for long periods to\n","participate in training programs at the Tokyo Head Office, the dormitories are also widely used for global\n","networking among employees.\n","\n","75\n","\n","Human Resources Management\n","\n","Appropriate Appointment and Allocation of Personnel\n","\n"," \n","\n","Policy of Placing the Right People in the Right Positions\n","\n"," \n","\n","People are the most important assets for the Mitsui & Co. global group.

Based on the individual employee's characteristics, expertise,\n","operational capabilities, areas of specialty, and experience, we formulate a plan for the development and\n","utilization of our human resources and implement appropriate and optimized personnel assignments. Also,\n","in order for our valuable human resources to fully exert their individual capabilities, we have introduced the\n","following human resource mobilization measures, which facilitate assignments beyond organizational\n","boundaries.\n","\n","Strategic Allocation of Human Resources\n","\n","Human resources are vital but finite management resources. Taking into account the external environment\n","and the balance between our business portfolios and profits, we agilely transfer and position our human\n","resources to growth domains that we have defined as targets under our management policies. We are\n","continually implementing human resource allocation measures such as the ones listed below to\n","accelerate our business offensives, which has resulted in the promotion of business by diverse, talented\n","professionals.\n","\n","Through the fiscal years ended March 2016 and 2020, we allocated 36 people from resource business\n","into non-resource growth business, such as healthcare and nutrition & agriculture. During the fiscal years\n","ended March 2018 and 2020, we have embodied our policy of growth-driven shift by transferring 107\n","people from corporate units to the frontlines of business, with the aim of streamlining corporate units and\n","strengthening business frontline units.\n","\n","From the fiscal year ending March 2021 and onward, we plan to further accelerate personnel transfers\n","to priority areas with our policy of “placing the right people in the right positions’ in mind.\n","\fSocial\n","\n"," \n","\n","This system encourages employees to take up the challenge of assignments of their choice that are\n","beyond interorganizational boundaries.

If an employee wants to use his or her\n","capabilities, skills and specialist knowledge in a business area other than the one to which he or she is\n","currently assigned, and if it is judged that the transfer would be beneficial for both the employee\n","concerned and the company, and would enhance the competitiveness of our human resources and\n","organization, then a transfer will be implemented.
