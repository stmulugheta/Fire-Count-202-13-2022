    "\n",
    "This is a sentence-transformers model: It maps sentences & paragraphs to a 384 dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "It aims to train sentence embedding models on very large sentence level datasets using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective. The Language model used the pretrained nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased model and fine-tuned in on a 1B sentence pairs dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a contrastive learning objective: given a sentence from the pair, the model should predict which out of a set of randomly sampled other sentences, was actually paired with it in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intended uses\n",
    "Our model is intented to be used as a sentence and short paragraph encoder. Given an input text, it ouptuts a vector which captures the semantic information. The sentence vector may be used for information retrieval, clustering or sentence similarity tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, input text longer than 256 word pieces is truncated.\n",
    "\n",
